# Recommendations:-
1. Focus on City Category C: Given that more than 50% of customers are from City Category C, Walmart should prioritize this category in terms of marketing efforts, product assortment, and store locations. They can allocate more resources to understand the preferences and needs of customers in this category and tailor their offerings accordingly.
2. Optimize Stores in City Categories B and C: Since almost 80% of customers are from City Categories B and C combined, Walmart should focus on optimizing its stores in these categories. This could involve expanding existing stores, opening new stores in strategic locations, or enhancing the shopping experience to attract and retain customers. Also company should try to reduce its expenses in City category A.
3. Product Assortment: Company should try to analyze the demographics and preferences of customers in each City Category and adjust their product assortment accordingly. They can stock products that are popular among the local population and ensure that stores are well-stocked to meet customer demand.
4. Community Engagement, events and online presence: Walmart can organize events or initiatives targeted at male consumers and singles to enhance community engagement and foster brand loyalty. This could include workshops, social gatherings, or educational seminars focused on topics relevant to these demographics.
5. Product Assortment for Specific Occupations: Since most consumers are from occupation codes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 17, Walmart can analyze the shopping patterns and preferences of individuals in these occupations and adjust its product assortment accordingly. This could involve stocking work-related items, professional attire, or specialized equipment that may be relevant to these occupations.
6. Targeted Marketing and Product Placement: Walmart can tailor its marketing efforts and product placement strategies to cater to the preferences and needs of male as well as unmarried consumers. This could involve featuring products that appeal to male interests and lifestyle choices more prominently in stores and advertising campaigns.

This could involve expanding store presence, enhancing product offerings, and implementing targeted marketing campaigns to attract and retain customers in City Category B.
8. Targeted Marketing for Age Groups: Given the lack of revenue from age groups 0-17 and 55+ in City Category A, Walmart can develop targeted marketing strategies to appeal to these age groups. This could involve offering products and promotions tailored to the specific needs and preferences of these demographics, as well as engaging in community outreach efforts to increase awareness and participation among these age groups.
9. Product Category Focus: Given that there are no significant purchases happening for product categories 9 to 20 and revenue generated from them is very low, Walmart should evaluate the performance of these categories and consider adjusting its product assortment strategy. This could involve reallocating resources to focus on more profitable categories and potentially phasing out or repositioning products within underperforming categories.
10. Affordable Options for Low-Value Categories: Conversely, product category 19, identified as the least expensive category, may appeal to cost-conscious consumers looking for budget-friendly options. Walmart can capitalize on this by highlighting affordable products, offering value deals or discounts, and positioning itself as a destination for budget-conscious shoppers.

Understanding the typical expense levels can help Walmart tailor its product assortment and promotional activities to better meet the needs and preferences of its target customers.
14. Pricing and Promotion Strategies: Walmart can use the confidence intervals to assess the effectiveness of pricing and promotion strategies aimed at influencing customer spending. For example, if the mean expense falls within the lower end of the confidence interval, Walmart may consider implementing targeted promotions or discounts to encourage higher spending among customers.
15. Gender-Based Spending Analysis: The non-overlapping confidence intervals for male and female expenses suggest that there may be a significant difference in spending behavior between genders. Walmart can use this insight to tailor marketing strategies and product offerings to better target male and female customers separately. For example, they could develop gender-specific promotions or adjust product assortments based on the preferences of each gender.
16. Marital Status and Spending: The overlapping confidence intervals for married and unmarried customers suggest that there may not be a significant difference in spending behavior based on marital status. Walmart can leverage this insight to develop inclusive marketing strategies that appeal to both married and unmarried customers.
